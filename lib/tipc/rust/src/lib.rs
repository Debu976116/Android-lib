//! # The Trusty IPC Library
//!
//! Implements IPC between Trusty userspace apps, the Trusty kernel, and the
//! non-secure kernel (Android).
//!
//! This library is based around the [`Handle`] type, which is an open
//! communication channel between a client and a service. This handle can send
//! and receive messages which implement [`Serialize`] and [`Deserialize`],
//! respectively. Receiving a message blocks until a message arrives or the
//! handle is closed.
