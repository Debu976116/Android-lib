//! A "once initialization" primitive
//!
//! This primitive is meant to be used to run one-time initialization. An
//! example use case would be for initializing an FFI library.
//!
//! This primitive is *not* thread-safe in the Trusty implementation, as
//! userspace threads are not yet supported.

// A "once" is a relatively simple primitive, and it's also typically provided
// by the OS as well (see `pthread_once` or `InitOnceExecuteOnce`). The OS
// primitives, however, tend to have surprising restrictions, such as the Unix
// one doesn't allow an argument to be passed to the function.
//
// As a result, we end up implementing it ourselves in the standard library.
// This also gives us the opportunity to optimize the implementation a bit which
// should help the fast path on call sites. Consequently, let's explain how this
// primitive works now!
//
// So to recap, the guarantees of a Once are that it will call the
// initialization closure at most once, and it will never return until the one
// that's running has finished running. This means that we need some form of
// blocking here while the custom callback is running at the very least.
// Additionally, we add on the restriction of **poisoning**. Whenever an
// initialization closure panics, the Once enters a "poisoned" state which means
// that all future calls will immediately panic as well.
//
// So to implement this, one might first reach for a `Mutex`, but those cannot
// be put into a `static`. It also gets a lot harder with poisoning to figure
// out when the mutex needs to be deallocated because it's not after the closure
// finishes, but after the first successful closure finishes.
//
// All in all, this is instead implemented with atomics and lock-free
// operations! Whee! Each `Once` has one word of atomic state, and this state is
// CAS'd on to determine what to do. There are four possible state of a `Once`:
//
// * Incomplete - no initialization has run yet, and no thread is currently
//                using the Once.
// * Poisoned - some thread has previously attempted to initialize the Once, but
//              it panicked, so the Once is now poisoned. There are no other
//              threads currently accessing this Once.
// * Running - some thread is currently attempting to run initialization. It may
//             succeed, so all future threads need to wait for it to finish.
//             Note that this state is accompanied with a payload, described
//             below.
// * Complete - initialization has completed and all future calls should finish
//              immediately.
//
// With 4 states we need 2 bits to encode this, and we use the remaining bits
// in the word we have allocated as a queue of threads waiting for the thread
// responsible for entering the RUNNING state. This queue is just a linked list
// of Waiter nodes which is monotonically increasing in size. Each node is
// allocated on the stack, and whenever the running closure finishes it will
// consume the entire queue and notify all waiters they should try again.
//
// You'll find a few more details in the implementation, but that's the gist of
// it!
//
// Atomic orderings:
// When running `Once` we deal with multiple atomics:
// `Once.state_and_queue` and an unknown number of `Waiter.signaled`.
// * `state_and_queue` is used (1) as a state flag, (2) for synchronizing the
//   result of the `Once`, and (3) for synchronizing `Waiter` nodes.
//     - At the end of the `call_inner` function we have to make sure the result
//       of the `Once` is acquired. So every load which can be the only one to
//       load COMPLETED must have at least Acquire ordering, which means all
//       three of them.
//     - `WaiterQueue::Drop` is the only place that may store COMPLETED, and
//       must do so with Release ordering to make the result available.
//     - `wait` inserts `Waiter` nodes as a pointer in `state_and_queue`, and
//       needs to make the nodes available with Release ordering. The load in
//       its `compare_exchange` can be Relaxed because it only has to compare
//       the atomic, not to read other data.
//     - `WaiterQueue::Drop` must see the `Waiter` nodes, so it must load
//       `state_and_queue` with Acquire ordering.
//     - There is just one store where `state_and_queue` is used only as a
//       state flag, without having to synchronize data: switching the state
//       from INCOMPLETE to RUNNING in `call_inner`. This store can be Relaxed,
//       but the read has to be Acquire because of the requirements mentioned
//       above.
// * `Waiter.signaled` is both used as a flag, and to protect a field with
//   interior mutability in `Waiter`. `Waiter.thread` is changed in
//   `WaiterQueue::Drop` which then sets `signaled` with Release ordering.
//   After `wait` loads `signaled` with Acquire and sees it is true, it needs to
//   see the changes to drop the `Waiter` struct correctly.
// * There is one place where the two atomics `Once.state_and_queue` and
//   `Waiter.signaled` come together, and might be reordered by the compiler or
//   processor. Because both use Acquire ordering such a reordering is not
//   allowed, so no need for SeqCst.
